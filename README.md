### Story
For the perfect Christmas mood, of course, a delicious punch is needed. Your task is to help David find the ingredients in the house before the guests arrive. To get more time, there is a "Health" station. There you can get another time boost every 20 seconds. But also beware of the Enemy, he will steal 20 seconds of your time and try to chase you.
If you really manage to collect all 7 ingredients in time and throw them into the pot one after the other, then David's friends will come and you will enjoy the punch together.
